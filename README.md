# Handwritten Name Recognition - Lightweight CRNN for Mobile Devices

This repository contains the code and final report for Machine Learning I course project: a compact CRNN-based model for recognizing handwritten names. The model is optimized for mobile deployment by combining MobileNetV3 with a BiLSTM decoder and multi-head attention.

## Key Features

- Optimized for mobile devices  
- 10.9M parameters (10x smaller than EasyOCR)  
- Trained on IAM dataset (handwritten English names)  
- Real-time performance on smartphones  
- Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts  

---

## Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: MobileNetV3 (input: `64x256x1`)  
- **Decoder**: BiLSTM + Multi-head Attention  
- **Output**: Character sequences with [Start], [End], and [PAD] tokens  

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: IAM Handwriting Dataset  
- **Size**: ~330,000 character images  
- **Writers**: 657 individuals, 13,353 text lines  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Resized to `64x256`  
  - Centered on canvas  
  - OTSU binarized and morphologically cleaned  

---

## Training

- Cosine learning rate decay with warmup  
- Adam optimizer with gradient clipping  
- Regularization (L1/L2) on LSTM weights  
- Early stopping & LR scheduling via Keras callbacks  
- Trained on Google Colab with GPU (T4)  

---

## Evaluation

- Sequence Accuracy (case-insensitive)  
- Edit Distance (mean and std)  
- MAE & MSE of predicted string lengths  
- Bias-variance gap per epoch  
- Training/validation accuracy and loss logging
